# Alamofire + AlamofireObjectMapper + Realm

This repository contains code for a talk on Alamofire, AlamofireObjectMapper and
Realm that I did at [CocoaHeads Sthlm, April 3 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuKehlKoN7o&lc=z22qu35a4xawiriehacdp435fnpjgmq2f54mjmyhi2tw03c010c.1502618893412377).

The `master` branch contains source code for a Swift 3-based demo app, while the
`gh-pages` contains the static api, which is used by the app.

The demo app should be portable to Swift 4.2 and the latest version of Alamofire,
AlamofireObjectMapper and Realm, with little effort.

A blog post that describes the demo app and its concepts can be found [here](http://danielsaidi.com/blog/2017/08/23/alamofire-realm#comment-4249670507).
